## November 2023

- Continued work on the modernization of a student loan application for a Canadian provincial government. The project is a .NET [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) server application, so I've been continuing my journey in building UI in [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/).
- Travelled to Chile for 10 days with my partner. We travelled to Punta Arenas and saw penguins on [Magdalena Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalena_Island,_Magallanes_Region); to Puerto Natales and day-hiked in [Torres del Paine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_del_Paine_National_Park) park (incl. the Mirador Las Torres hike); to San Pedro de Atacama and saw the [Valle de la Luna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valle_de_la_Luna_(Chile)), the [El Tatio Geysers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Tatio) and [Laguna Cejar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salar_de_Atacama); and to Santiago where we enjoyed the city and nearby [Valpara√≠so](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valpara%C3%ADso). I'm hoping over some quiet time over the holidays to write a few longer-form posts about our experience.
