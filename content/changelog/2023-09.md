## September 2023

- I had hoped I'd be back coding this month after a month off, but life had other plans. My dad suffered a detached retina at the beginning of the month, and as the only driver in the household in a remote town, needed someone to help with driving. So I spent the first part of the month up in Bobcaygeon doing a fair bit of care-giving for my parents. My dad had surgery and is on the mend though we don't know the prognosis for a return of vision in the affected eye yet... it may never return. 
- In addition to my dad's injury, the consulting company I work through continued to suffer a sales drout throughout September, as they did in August. They eventually succeeded in securing some work for me and some others who have been "on the bench" for a few months, which begins in October. I can't say much about the project but it will have me using [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) to build UI. I have hard feelings about that choice (including that it's seemingly not my choice, notwithstanding I'll be in the role of UI architect / lead dev) but I'm doing my best to remain positive. ðŸ˜Š
- These were [the songs that carried me through September](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4Wki8eXht690vNuNvaH6QV?si=792b191b6f7f4ca4).
