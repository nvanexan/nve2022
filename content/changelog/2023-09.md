## September 2023

- My dad suffered a detached retina at the beginning of the month, so I spent the first half of the month up north doing some care-giving.
- I'll be starting a new contract for a provincial government for the modernization of its studen loan system at the end of October.
- Started looking harder at [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) for UI development, as it's a requirement for the above project. First impressions: I can see why C# devs might be attracted to this framework, but it's not something I'd otherwise reach for or recommend. I'll try to publish more in-depth thoughts in some blog posts later this year.
- These were [the songs that carried me through September](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4Wki8eXht690vNuNvaH6QV?si=792b191b6f7f4ca4).
