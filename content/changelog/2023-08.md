## August 2023

- Took some time off this month to fix some things around the house. Also spent a bunch of time catching up with people we missed during the winter and the pandemic.
- September is just around the corner, and I'm really excited to get back to coding and a regular work routine more generally.
- Found a very fun collection of [short docs of Berlin Bike Messengers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIbZ_zE4RZc&list=PLkoL530rRZy-MK0Szsn_Z-AiEHsNps-gj) by [Claire Tayler](https://www.instagram.com/de.tour/). They're very well done, and remind me of my time there ~10 years ago. I really do miss that city. ðŸ˜”
- These were [the songs that carried me through August](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/58ZauUIFKRes17ccQfp94o?si=5a3eb9d5966d4777).
