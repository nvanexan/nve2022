This is the equation describing the second law of thermodynamics. It tells us that heat passes from hot bodies to cold ones, never the other way around. S in this equation denotes entropy: a thermodynamic quantity representing the unavailability of a system's thermal energy for conversion into mechanical work, often interpreted as the degree of disorder or randomness in a closed system.

This is the only equation in physics that gives time its arrow, according to Marco Rovelli in [The Order of Time](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/551483/the-order-of-time-by-carlo-rovelli/). It’s the only law of physics that separates future from present from past. It’s a remarkable notion to contemplate:

> The fact that entropy has been low in the past leads to an important fact that is ubiquitous and crucial for the difference between past and future: the past leaves traces of itself in the present.[^1]

I read this passage in Rovelli's [The Order of Time](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/551483/the-order-of-time-by-carlo-rovelli/) and it's sort of stuck with me, like inception. I'm not sure why. But there's a couple of interesting ideas to contemplate here for me I guess:

1. Our present isn't just "informed" by our past. It contains it.
2. The arrow of time is a gradual disordering of previously more particularized states.

Why care about this? I suppose, at some level, it's relevant to remember that the us that exists today contains the us that existed yesterday, but with more disordering; with more contact and collision and friction with other things, including people. And it's also probably relevant to remember that while we can't not collide and make contact with, or transfer heat to, other people and things, we _can_ control _how_ those interactions take place. We can be dicks. Or we can be kind. We can take care of each other.

The second law of thermodynamics - the arrow of time - tells us that either way it's impossible in a closed system to put things back to a more ordered state. So the choice we have as humans, really, is _how_ to expend our energy: to things, people, careers, life, etc. Life is always moving towards more disorder. You can't easily escape that. But if you try a little bit, you might be able to shape the disordering into something net positive. You might be able to ensure that the traces you leave in others are happy ones, positive ones, traces of hope.

It's the simplest equation. It contains multitudes. It reminds me that we collide with one another, and leave traces in one another. It reminds me that if there's one goal worth pursuing, it's probably, simply, trying to make those traces as positive as I can. Looking back, I haven't always done well at remembering this. Looking forward, it's still a goal worthy of pursuit. I'm working on it.
