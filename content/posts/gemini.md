This week I discovered the [Gemini Protocol](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/). I'm loving the underlying philosophy and ambition.

Gemini is a new internet protocol that is text-based. Just as NASA's Gemini project was a kind of middle ground between the MVP Mercury project and the full-on, feature-rich Apollo missions, Gemini the protocol aims to be a kind of middle ground between Gopher and the web.

There is no javascript in Gemini. No trackers. No cookies. No social networks. No fucking web3â„¢.

The syntax for creating gemini content (gemtext) is very similar to markdown. And the output is primarily just text.

There are already many open source libraries for creating Gemini servers and clients.[^1] My favourite client[^2] is [Amfora](https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/amfora), a CLI. Here's me reading the [Hundred Rabbits](https://100r.co/) wiki on Amfora.

Gemini appeals to me. I'm not sure why. It's not usable the way the web is; it takes effort to learn it. And content isn't very easily discoverable. But I think that's maybe the appeal. There's a little community of people here that also like the idea of a small internet that provides a more defined space for thoughts and words. People that also write their own CLIs, take notes in vim, and still use pgp.[^3] It's nice.

I feel like with the Gemini protocol I've entered a kind of electronic speakeasy. It's cozy here.

It reminds me of the internet I loved as a teenager. I'm keen to hang out here for a bit.
