- Started work for a new client, a publicly traded provider of human resources software. I'm working to help make their aging [Dojo](https://dojotoolkit.org/) / [React](https://reactjs.org/) codebase accessible to [WCAG Level AA spec](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance). It's not sexy work, but I like the idea that I'm enabling human rights.

- These are [the songs that carried me through January](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4gSjDpT2Ji05A4VEL5n2A6?si=e2f98e53be87497a). A lot of shoegaze, perhaps echoing the blurring of days for me right now.

- Finished some UI and serverless API work for an old client, a local management consulting firm, on a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [Prismic](https://prismic.io/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) stack. I'm more keen on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as a React framework and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for CI/CD these days, but it was fun to be working on the front-end again all the same.
- With Omicron present in our city, I stopped going to the gym. My back is not happy.
