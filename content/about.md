Heya ðŸ‘‹, I'm Nick.

I'm a software developer and data protection consultant (CIPP C/E). I live in Toronto and work virtually across a few time zones. 

Most of my software development work is for clients of a Microsoft Azure focused consultancy in Toronto called [ObjectSharp](https://objectsharp.com). I'm what you'd probably call a senior full-stack JavaScript / TypeScript developer. I'm fluent in the "front end" of the "stack" and I derive tremendous joy from creating usable and accessible interfaces, but I have also spent  my fair share of time building dev tools, APIs and microservices that run on Node. 

I am also a certified privacy professional for Europe and Canada and a member of the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP). I advise companies on matters related to privacy engineering, such as architectures for enabling data subject rights, and related compliance goals.

In my free time, I like to hang out with my dog, George, run long distances, watch live music and contribute to open source software.
