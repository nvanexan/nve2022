Heya ðŸ‘‹, I'm Nick.

I'm a senior software developer and data protection consultant. I've been working in tech for over 20 years, with clients across the spectrum from high-growth startups to large, multinational SaaS providers. 

I am currently a senior consultant with [Centrilogic](https://www.centrilogic.com/) (formerly [ObjectSharp](https://objectsharp.com/)), where I help organizations  design and develop modern web applications primarily in the Microsoft Azure cloud. My primary focus is on front-end web development and building design systems that deliver accessible and performant UI at scale, but I also have signficant experience on the back-end building microservices in NodeJS and containerizing them for deployment in Azure Kubernetes clusters.

I also consult on matters related to privacy and data protection through my own company, [Fieldwork](https://fieldwork.is). As a former lawyer and a current Certified Information Privacy Professional (CIPP) for Canada and Europe with the  [International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP)](https://iapp.org/), I have a unique background that allows me to work seamlessly as a privacy engineer for organizations needing clear communication of privacy requirements and technical architectural guidance on matters related to data protection.

Companies I've had the pleasure of working with include:

In my free time, I like to spend time with my partner, Carmen, and our dog, George. I love running long distances, learning to play the guitar, and contributing to open source software.
