Heya ðŸ‘‹, I'm Nick.

I'm a senior software developer and data protection consultant. I've been making things for the web for over 20 years, for myself and for clients ranging from high-growth startups to multinational SaaS providers. 

I am currently a senior consultant with [Centrilogic](https://www.centrilogic.com/) (formerly [ObjectSharp](https://objectsharp.com/)), where I help organizations design and develop modern web applications. My primary focus is on front-end web development and building design systems that deliver accessible and performant UI at scale. I also have experience on the back-end building micro-services for the Microsoft Azure cloud.

In addition to my software engineering work, I consult on matters related to privacy and data protection through my company, [Fieldwork](https://fieldwork.is). As a former lawyer and a current [Certified Information Privacy Professional (CIPP)](https://iapp.org/certify/cipp/) for Canada and Europe, I have a unique background that allows me to work seamlessly as a privacy engineer. In this role, I provide guidance to organizations on how to decrease privacy risks and implement effective controls in their information systems.

Companies I've had the pleasure of working with include:

In my free time, I like to spend time with my partner, Carmen, and our dog, George. I love running long distances, learning to play the guitar, and contributing to open source software.
