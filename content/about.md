Heya ðŸ‘‹, I'm Nick.

I'm a software developer and data protection consultant (CIPP C/E). I live in Toronto but work virtually across several time zones.

I've been writing code for about 20 years, since I was a teenager. My early days were focused on Flash and building innovative UIs with ActionScript. My heroes at the time were folks like [Joshua Davis](https://joshuadavis.com/), [Hillman Curtis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillman_Curtis), [James Paterson (Presstube)](https://twitter.com/presstube) and [Amit Pitaru](https://pitaru.com/). I won a [SXSW Web Award](https://www.sxsw.com/awards/) in 2004 for my work at the time. I couldn't attend because I was still in school and had exams.

I took a professional detour in my twenties to accomplish some personal goals, which included going to law school at the [University of Toronto Faculty of Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Toronto_Faculty_of_Law). I graduated with a Juris Doctor in 2011, and finished well enough to get a Big Law job. I went on to practice litigation on Bay Street for 4-5 years.

In 2015, law school debts paid off, I grew tired of fighting with people for a living and returned to what was my true calling: making stuff with code. I reconnected with some friends at [ObjectSharp](https://objectsharp.com), a local software development consultancy, and joined a team beginning work for a leading Fintech on a SaaS compliance platform. I was the first front-end engineer on the team and entrusted with scaffolding the UI in a scalable way. Working closely with the product owner and business analyst, I architected and coded the first iteration of the UI for Finastra's [Fusion Compliance Management](https://www.finastra.com/solutions/brochures/fusion-compliance-management) platform.

In 2017, with my knowledge of engineering but also regulatory - and particulary privacy - law, I seized an opportunity to work with the legal team at [Hootsuite](https://hootsuite.com) as their Product &amp; Privacy Counsel. In that role, I helped design and lead the development of Hootsuite's data protection and GDPR compliance strategy, an exercise in change management that involved coordinating the tactical and strategic implementation of compliance initiatives across 20 different divisions within the company.

I left Hootsuite and returned to consulting in 2018, so I could do more software development work and advise a greater variety of companies on privacy and data protection matters.

Today I split my time about 80-20% between software engineering and privacy consulting. On the engineering side, I'm what you'd probably call a senior full-stack JavaScript (TypeScript now) developer. I'm fluent in the front end of the "stack", but have also spent significant time building Node microservices, editing Dockerfiles, working with cloud native databases, service hubs, etc. On the privacy side, I am what you might call a "privacy engineer". I am happy to advise legal departments who are in their infancy of setting up a privacy program, but my biggest value add is more as a translator between Legal and IT / Engineering.
