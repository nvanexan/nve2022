Heya ðŸ‘‹, I'm Nick.

I'm an independent software developer and data protection consultant (CIPP C/E). I live in Toronto but work virtually across a few time zones. 

I've been writing code for about 20 years, since I was a teenager. My early days were focused on Flash and building innovative UIs with ActionScript. My heroes at the time were folks like [Joshua Davis](https://joshuadavis.com/), [Hillman Curtis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillman_Curtis), [James Paterson (Presstube)](https://twitter.com/presstube) and [Amit Pitaru](https://pitaru.com/). I won a [SXSW Web Award](https://www.sxsw.com/awards/) in 2004 for my work at the time. I couldn't attend because I was still in school and had exams. 

Today I'm what you'd probably call a senior full-stack JavaScript /TypeScript developer. I'm fluent in the "front end" of the "stack" and I still derive tremendous joy from creating UI, but I have also spent  my fair share of time building dev tools, APIs and microservices that run on Node. 

I am also a certified privacy professional for Europe and Canada and a member of the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP). I advise companies on matters related to privacy engineering, such as architectures for enabling data subject rights, and related compliance goals.

In my free time, I like to hang out with my dog, George, run long distances, watch live music and contribute to open source software.
